  I don't have our official internal reference, but he provided a doc for me, which i think could be modified as an official doc.
  
  I make it as an attachment in this mail, as a reference for you.
 
  Here are some Internet links I use to learn git:
 
  https://www.cnblogs.com/syp172654682/p/7689328.html (use it to learn what's git and how git works, I think it's the foundation to use git)
  https://www.runoob.com/git/git-tutorial.html (Find a solution quickly)
  https://git-scm.com/docs (Git Reference)
